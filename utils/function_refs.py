def make_ref(refs_list: List[Callable] = []) -> Callable:
    """
    Decorator factory to create a decorator that tracks references to decorated functions.

    Parameters:
        refs_list (List[Callable], optional): A list to store references to decorated functions.
            If not provided, it defaults to an empty list.

    Returns:
        decorator (Callable): A decorator function that can be used to decorate other functions.
            The decorator adds the reference of the decorated function to the `refs_list` and
            then returns the original function without any modification.

    Example:
        @make_ref(referenced_functions)
        def foo():
            return "Hello, world!"

        @make_ref(referenced_functions)
        def bar():
            return "This is another function."

        # At this point, referenced_functions will contain references to the decorated functions foo and bar.

        # You can call the decorated functions as usual:
        result_foo = foo()
        result_bar = bar()

    Note:
        The `make_ref` decorator factory can be used in various scenarios where you need to track
        references to decorated functions, such as logging, event handling, or other custom use cases.
